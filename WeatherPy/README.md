# python-api-challenge
In this deliverable, we'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator


#This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

#Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

We'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Then we should create the following plots, explaining what the linear regression is modeling:

Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude


#Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, we'll use our weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, we'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
The main tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library to create map visualizations.


1.Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.

2.Create a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity and display it inot a map.
